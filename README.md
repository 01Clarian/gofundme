## Architecture

### Token Purchase Flow
1. User submits SOL payment
2. 10% transaction fee sent to fee wallet
3. Remaining 90% SOL used to buy SUNO tokens via:
   - **Primary**: PumpPortal API (with auto pool detection)
   - **Fallback**: Jupiter Aggregator
4. Tokens split between user and competition pool
5. User receives their portion immediately

### Competition Phases
1. **Submission Phase** (5 minutes): Users share stories and make payments
2. **Voting Phase** (5 minutes): Community votes on stories
3. **Winners Phase**: Top 5 stories win prizes, bonus prize chance activates
4. **Cooldown** (1 minute): Brief pause before next round starts

### Tier System
- üéµ **Basic** (0.01-0.049 SOL): 50% retention, 1.0x multiplier
- üíé **Mid Tier** (0.05-0.099 SOL): 55% retention, 1.05x multiplier
- üëë **High Tier** (0.10-0.499 SOL): 60% retention, 1.10x multiplier
